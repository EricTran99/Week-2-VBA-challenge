# Week-2-VBA-challenge
This is the module 2 challenge from week 2 which is VBA focused

In this one, the challenge was to create a VBA script that runs in all of the sheet to group all of the letters, find the first opening and last closing price for each letter group, calculate the yearly change, highlight the color depending on the change being surplus or surminus and create a column with the yearly change as percentage.
The second section was to find the highest value, link to the correct letter and have all of the code run in all of the worksheet.

There's gonna be one  folder which contains:
1. the macro-enabled excel of "vba-challenge" which I've edited to prove my vba script
2. the screenshot of the result
